What is the Polyglotte® [multilingual keyboard](https://patents.justia.com/inventor/maria-daniela-semeco)?
 
The Polyglotte® keyboard is made for cross-cultural communication and lets you type correctly in multiple languages without slowing down! Our novel keyboard design is a software solution that works with a physical computer keyboard as well as mobile devices. We overcame the challenge of creating a solution that spans all platforms, whether you write on an iPad or touch type.

The idea was born in February 2011. We had a limited budget and used resources at hand. Family and friends helped launch the first prototypes and mobile applications.

In September, 2014 Apple opened its doors to third-party keyboards, and our [universal app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id946591425) (for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch) hit the market March 30th, 2015. With this new product, we introduced keyboard localization for the first time (QWERTY, AZERTY, QWERTZ).

Our keyboard now supports 25 languages and more than 250 symbols. Type in multiple languages without losing your train of thought, stopping to look up a special character, or Googling a word to copy and paste it into your document.

Our new mechanical keycap sets are also compatible with ISO.

What is [ISO](https://deskthority.net/wiki/ANSI_vs_ISO) and why does it matter?

ISO is used in many countries in the world. Its familiarity makes it important, because people are busy, and stopping to learn a new keyboard layout is a time-consuming hassle. ISO layouts have a shortened left ‘Shift’ key and an extra key cap to the left of the ‘Z’ key (if you’re typing QWERTY). They also have an ‘L’ shaped ‘Enter’ key.

Our multilingual keyboards adapt to this configuration with or without the ‘L’ shaped ‘Enter’. The reality is that few keycap sets in the world conform to ISO. We offer both possibilities for those who like to mix and match keycaps.
